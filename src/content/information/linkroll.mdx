I can't believe you're reading this!
If you made it this far you've probably read all of my content. 
Here are some external sites that I think will deepen this rabbit hole you're so intent on following:

<Linkroll locale={props.locale} links={resource_links} />

In the immortal words of DJ Khaled, "Another one.":

<Linkroll locale={props.locale} links={fun_links} />

If you're back here after those, welcome back!
You obviously have something in mind, so why not [reach out](mailto:Justin.jb78+vesta.aeterna@gmail.com?subject=Vesta%20Inquiry)?

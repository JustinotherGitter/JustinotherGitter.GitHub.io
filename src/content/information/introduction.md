Hi!
I'm Justin Cooper, a technically minded scientist and developer with a background in astrophysics, primarily focused on the calibration and automation of data reduction.
My foundations are in physics and mathematics, and they have provided me with a strong analytical skill set, which I currently apply to my work in software development, data science, and machine learning.

My interests are vast, with current focuses leaning towards the ever increasing [!!enshittification!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification "Yup, thats the actual term") of software that I have been noticing.
Other tangential rabbit holes include machine learning, defensive coding practices, and the development of robust, maintainable software systems.
I am passionate about creating tools that not only solve immediate problems but are also designed for long-term use and adaptability.

I am an experienced `Python` developer and data scientist, a novice `C` and `C#` backend software engineer, and a fledgling `Rust` programmer and admirer.
I have experience working in various environments $-$ from high-performance computing clusters to microcontrollers.

Now that that's out of the way, here's a little about me outside of a '$9-5$':

In my free time I enjoy being active, and (to the best of my ability) creative.
I hold a second dan black belt in Haedong Kumdo, am a social dancer (specifically [sokkie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokkie "So named for the shoes you generally wear, none!")), dabble in digital generative art, and like to *think* I'm learning languages!

**Vesta Æterna** was created as an outlet for me to share my projects, ideas, and insights with a broader audience.
I intend for it to be my human musings, failings, and successes $-$ a space where I can express myself beyond the constraints of code and data.
With the internet's traffic and content becoming increasingly more AI generated, I intend for a space that is distinctly human.
Please reach out if you have any questions or comments, or just want to say hello!

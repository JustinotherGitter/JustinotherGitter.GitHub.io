Justin Cooper is a technically minded scientist and developer with a background in astrophysics, primarily focused on the calibration and automation of data reductions.
His foundation in physics and mathematics has provided him with a strong analytical skill set, which he applies to his work in software development and data science.

His interests are often vast, with current focuses including Machine Learning, defensive coding practices, and the development of robust, maintainable software systems.
He is passionate about creating tools that not only solve immediate problems but are also designed for long-term use and adaptability.

Justin is fluent with several programming languages, the most prominent being `Python`, `C`, and `Rust`.
He has experience working in various environments $-$ from high-performance computing clusters to microcontrollers.

In his free time, Justin enjoys being active, and (to the best of his ability) creative.
He holds a second dan black belt in Haedong Kumdo, is a social dancer, dabbles in digital generative art, and likes to think he's learning languages.

**Vesta Æterna** was created as an outlet for Justin to share his projects, ideas, and insights with a broader audience.
With the internet's traffic and content becoming increasingly more AI generated, he intends for a space that is distinctly human.
